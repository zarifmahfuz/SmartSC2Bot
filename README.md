# SmartSC2Bot

# Building
## Requirements
* [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* StarCraft II ([Windows](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/)) ([Linux](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#linux-packages)) 
* [StarCraft II Map Packs](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#map-packs)

Install StarCraft II and extract the contents of the Ladder 2017 Season 1 map pack into the `Maps` directory in the install location of StarCraft II. If it doesn't exist, create it. On Windows, by default it is `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Maps`.

## Windows

Download and install [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) if you need it. Building with Visual Studio 2019 not yet supported.

```bat
:: Clone the project
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/zarifmahfuz/SmartBot.git
$ cd SmartBot

:: Create build directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

:: Generate VS solution.
$ cmake ../ -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"

:: Build the project using Visual Studio.
$ start BasicSc2Bot.sln
```

## Mac

Note: Try opening the SC2 game client before installing. If the game crashes before opening, you may need to change your Share name:
* Open `System Preferences`
* Click on `Sharing`
* In the `Computer Name` textfield, change the default 'Macbook Pro' to a single word name (the exact name shouldn't matter, as long as its not the default name)

```bat
:: Clone the project
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/zarifmahfuz/SmartBot.git
$ cd SmartBot

:: Create build directory.
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

:: Generate a Makefile
:: Use 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../' if debug info is needed
$ cmake ../

:: Build
$ make
```

# Running
First, configure the BasicSc2Bot project's command-line arguments to debug with:
1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the BasicSc2Bot project under the solution in the Solution Explorer.
2. Click Properties.
3. In the top-left of the window that appears, set the Configuration to "Active(Debug)".
4. Select the Debugging page under Configuration Properties on the left.
5. Set the value of Command Arguments to `-c -a zerg -d Hard -m CactusValleyLE.SC2Map`. This will result in the bot playing against the built-in Zerg AI on hard difficulty on the map CactusValleyLE.
6. Click OK.


You can press F5 or the â–¶ button at the top of Visual Studio to run the bot with the command-line arguments you configured.
